How did viewing a diff between the two versions help you debug the code?
By comparing the two files it was much easier to find a typo than it would have been
if I should have read through the entire document.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By making sure i only save these places I will always be able to find an earlier version that works. 
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
That you do not get too many commits.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because they have to different focusses.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
I can use it by finding different versions with git log and them comparing them with git diff
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you can easily restore it again.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
It could be in addition with other courses to make the version control. It should also make it easier to use this file.
