When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I would colaborate with orther or if I wish to save my work more than one place so it is not lost if the computer is.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you work together with someone else and on same branch it could make things complicated.
