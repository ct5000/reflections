What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
There is created an empty repository. It is necsesary(spelled) because you can't track it otherwise using git.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temporary place for your files. I think it makes it easier to make commits.
