What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
There is created an empty repository. It is necsesary(spelled) because you can't track it otherwise using git.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temporary place for your files. I think it makes it easier to make commits.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can compare it with the latest commit to make sure it is like that
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
I could make something i Python I would be sure about working and I would still be able to find a version which works.
